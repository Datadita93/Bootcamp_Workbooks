## Week 3 – SQL Skills Summary

During Week 3, I focused on understanding and applying core database concepts and SQL skills. Key activities included:  

- **Learning database concepts**:  
  - Explored primary keys, secondary keys, and foreign keys and their roles in ensuring data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.  

- **Understanding JOINs**:  
  - Researched and explained different types of SQL JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and how they are used to combine related data from multiple tables.  
  - Provided practical examples showing which datasets each JOIN type could be applied to.  

- **Database design for a small retail business**:  
  - Analyzed business requirements, identifying data needs for inventory, sales, customer information, and loyalty programs.  
  - Designed database schema including tables and relationships to efficiently manage operations.  
  - Wrote SQL examples to create tables, define relationships, and implement constraints.  
  - Practiced populating databases with `INSERT` statements and maintaining accuracy.  
  - Considered database maintenance, backups, and security measures to ensure a robust system.  

- **SQL practical exercises**:  
  - Set up and explored the `world_db` database.  
  - Executed SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.  
  - Documented both the SQL syntax and the query outputs, reinforcing hands-on experience.  

These tasks enhanced my understanding of database design, relational data management, and practical SQL skills, preparing me to create functional and efficient databases.

## Week 4 – Azure

During Week 4, I focused on developing knowledge of cloud computing concepts, cybersecurity legislation, and practical experience with Azure. Key activities included:  

- **Cloud computing fundamentals**:  
  - Researched core concepts of cloud computing and alternatives such as on-premises computing.  
  - Explored various cloud service offerings and their real-world use cases.  
  - Studied different cloud deployment models: public, private, hybrid, and community clouds, including when each model is appropriate and examples of organizations that could implement them.  

- **Cybersecurity and legislation**:  
  - Learned about the Computer Misuse Act 1990, understanding the types of computer-related offenses it addresses.  
  - Studied the Police and Justice Act 2006 (Computer Misuse) and the additional powers it grants to authorities.  

- **Practical Azure experience**:  
  - Completed Skillable labs (Lab 3–5) on exploring relational data in Azure, gaining hands-on experience in cloud-based database management and data exploration.  

These activities enhanced my understanding of cloud computing environments, cybersecurity legislation, and practical skills in using Azure to manage and explore relational data.

## Week 5 – Python

During Week 5, I focused on Python programming and data analysis using Pandas, developing skills in coding, data manipulation, and exploration. Key activities included:  

- **Python programming practice**:  
  - Implemented the FizzBuzz exercise, applying conditional statements and loops to iterate through integers and output results based on divisibility rules.  

- **Data loading and exploration using Pandas**:  
  - Read CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.  
  - Displayed the first and last rows, explored DataFrame structure, and generated summary statistics.  

- **Indexing, slicing, and selecting data**:  
  - Selected individual columns, multiple columns, specific rows, and filtered data based on conditions.  

- **Data manipulation**:  
  - Added new columns (e.g., a column to indicate if a student passed).  
  - Renamed columns and dropped unnecessary columns.  

- **Aggregation and grouping**:  
  - Grouped data by categorical columns to calculate means.
